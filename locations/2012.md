# locations/ Merging Wards & Electoral Division (2012)

Forty-three census wards and census electoral divisions (0.5% from a total of 9,505) were subject to merging to form the 19 census merged wards in the Wards and Electoral Divisions area list. A separate Merging Wards and Electoral Divisions area list contains only these census wards. Lower threshold aggregate outputs are available for the merging census wards, but not higher threshold aggregate outputs.

The boundaries are available as either extent of the realm (usually this is the Mean Low Water mark but in some cases boundaries extend beyond this to include off shore islands) or clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark).
