# location/ Merging Local Authorities (2011)

Four census districts (1% from a total of 406) were subject to merging to form the two census merged districts in the District Set. A separate Merging Census Districts Set contains only these census districts. Lower threshold aggregate outputs are available for the merging census districts, but not higher threshold aggregate outputs.

The boundaries are available as either extent of the realm (usually this is the Mean Low Water mark but in some cases boundaries extend beyond this to include off shore islands) or clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark).
